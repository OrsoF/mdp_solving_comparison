# mdp_solving_comparison

We aim here to compare three MDP solving methods in terms of computing time :
- MdpToolbox
- Linear Programming solving with GurobiPy
- Marmot

To Do:
- Fix Max Iter to compare
- Fix Epsilon for all solvers
- Add Taxi and change Gurobi to a premium license
- Add Ex40
- Remove example.py
